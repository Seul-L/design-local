            on these businesses to drive our economy by employing our people, and by remaining competitive. You can
            think of our local economy as out team. Strong teams not only encourage healthy competition they also look
            for ways to work together to take advantage of their strengths, and to look for opportunities to be even
            better. Design.local has a bold vision, and sees an opportunity where we can leverage a strength to help our
            community be even better.

            that they deliver. However, we also know that there are businesses and institutions that don’t utilize
            modern systems, platforms, processes, or tools to their best potential. This is either because they don’t
            have the know-how, resources, or access to people with the necessary skills on a full or even part-time
            basis.
