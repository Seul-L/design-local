        <p>
          As a society we know that our livlihoods depend on the health of the communities in which we live. A community
          is a group of individuals and businesses working together to create the quality of life that we all want and
          enjoy. In essence, our community is for all intensive purposes a team. Strong teams encourage healthy
          competition, but they also look for ways to work together to leverage and take advantage of their strengths,
          and to turn any possible weakness into opportunities to be capitalized on. Design.local has a bold vision, and
          sees an opportunity where strengths can be leveraged, and weaknesses minimized.

          We are all aware of the technology and innovation that is available to us these days, things like systems,
          tools, processes, and services. In fact, they will only continue to be develop at exponential rates, we get
          that and certainly appreciate the promises and potential that they deliver. However, we also know that there
          are businesses and institutions in our local communities that even in their own admittance don’t come close to
          taking advantage of what these types of innovations could offer them and more importantly their customers when
          utilized appropriately for them. This is either because they don’t have the know-how, resources, or access to
          people with the necessary design skills on a full or even part-time basis.
