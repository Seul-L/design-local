            <h1>Everyone is a designer.</h1>
            <p>
              We are a multidisciplinary group of creators, designers,
              strategists, and developers using our skills to solve design
              challenges for not-for-profit organizations in the Waterloo
              Region.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to give designers an environment to work with other
              designers on solving real problems for organizations that work to
              better our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are looking to give back to your local community, or you
              want to explore design problems from different industries, then
              this is for you.

            We believe that anyone who is a professional
            <span class="bold">problem solver</span> is a designer. Engineers,
            Graphic Designers, Visual Designers, Installation Artists,
            Architects, Musicians, Painters, Writers - these people are all
            designers because they output creative solutions to complex
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have created a platform that brings these great minds together.

            each design challenge, or go so far as to hire a member from the
            team if they want to explore the solution further.

            Organizations can choose to be as involved in the design process as
