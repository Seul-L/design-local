            on these businesses to drive our economy by employing our people, and by remaining competitive. You can

            for ways to work together to take advantage of their strengths, and to look for opportunities to be even
            better. Design.local has a bold vision, and sees an opportunity where we can leverage a strength to help our
            community be even better.
