        <h3>Open Sky Venture</h3>
        <p>As a business person who wants to improve the lives of others, Emile Mclean wants to positively influence the
          lives of Black people, and other people of colour. Emile sees an opportunity for career advice, financial
          literacy and entrepreneurship to empower people to take control of their future. Commerce is a vehicle of
          change that can help make a more equitable future, and Emile wants to make that happen.
        </p>
        <p>This first project is intended to establish an understanding of the audience to be reached - who are they,
          what are their specific needs, and how might we engage with them in the followup projects.

        <h2>UX Research</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          In Canada, Black, indigenous, and people of colour continue to face disadvantages due to systemic racism.
          While protest and public education are often the means used to create change, these are more often
          ineffective. Access to the tools of commerce has never been easier, as a smartphone and some ambition can be
          the only requirements to create a business. Through commerce, disadvantaged people can transform their lives -
          but they need help with financial literacy and the principles of entrepreneurship.
        </p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          Open Sky Ventures seeks to bring the tools and knowledge for commercial success to Black people, as well as
          other people of colour, to empower them to overcome their disadvantages and shape their futures. By reaching
          and teaching young people of colour, Open Sky Ventures will help them harness the potential of
          entrepreneurship to create greater personal and community success. A more just and equitable future lies in
          the economic well-being of all. </p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Young adults of colour (primary audience, white people are also welcome) in typically disadvantaged
            communities in Canada</li>
          <li>People who have a poor understanding of finance and commerce</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Empowering users to create their own business through the use of widely available technology</li>
          <li>Helping users to understand the principles of finance, and how to use them to create wealth</li>
          <li>Providing users with learning material and resources to use individually and share within their
            communities</li>
          <li>Advising users on career planning and personal development, including resume work, leadership training,
            and standing out in a company</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge as a means to empowerment</li>
          <li>Supporting the ambition of young people in particular (but all ages welcome)</li>
          <li>Commerce is a more effective means of social change than protest</li>
          <li>While the project has a focus on Black people, all are welcome</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Other Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The project will initially focus on Kitchener-Waterloo and Toronto</li>
          <li>Emile Mclean is the primary stakeholder, but will have support from other partners</li>
          <li>This first project is intended to establish an understanding of the audience to be reached - who are they,
            what are their specific needs, and how might we engage with them in the followup projects</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Possible Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>User research insights</li>
          <li>Create personas</li>
          <li>Recommendations for the best possible channels to reach the audience</li>
          <li>Empathy maps</li>
        </ul>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            We have set out to understand the needs of Black people and other people of colour who we believe will
            benefit from gaining financial literacy and learning how to use the tools of commerce to create their own
            business and career success, which will change their future.
