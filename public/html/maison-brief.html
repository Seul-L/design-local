        <h2>Branding & Event Design</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          We are looking to understand where we can bring value in the supply chain and would like to create workshops
          and seminars to teach people about food systems, growing their own food and reducing the stigma around
          sustainable food being expensive and/or inconvenient.
        </p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to help with building a brand and marketing workshops that are tailored towards
          food system/food economic education.<br>
          This specific project is a social good project around an area with rising concerns -- what will the future
          look like if food becomes expensive or there are increasing trends of food shortages, and how do I build a
          trusted food system where I understand where my food comes from. <br>People will be aware or be able to build
          a new skill set around growing their food or an understanding of food systems. The sustainable food community
          will be elevated and grow stronger, through sharing their learnings and experiences on growing meaningful
          yields of food from their own home. We would like people to become self-sufficient, and grow in confidence to
          the point that they are willing to experiment & share their learnings back with the community as citizen
          scientists.

        </p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p><b>Users who we identified are:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Urban dwellers with limited outdoor growing space</li>
          <li>Community Gardens</li>
          <li>Schools (elementary, secondary, post-secondary)</li>
          <li>Everyday consumers (Grocery shoppers)</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p><b>The pain points:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>These are all people who are impacted by the supply chain or have the ability to make better decisions
            when purchasing food.</li>
          <li>Provide nudges to grow interest amongst students to become interested in the agriculture/agri-tech
            field.
          </li>
          <li>Lower cost, and improved accessibility to fresh food year-round at home</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>We want to host knowledge-sharing workshops virtually on growing your own organic produce. We would love
          feedback on how to build an engaging workshop + help with designing an outreach campaign.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Repeat activities:</b> sign up for multiple future workshops, that build on their learnings. Share
            their experiences & interact with us on social media/blog to build community. Continue to grow & harvest
            crops. </li>
          <li><b>One time activities:</b> subscribe to newsletters and updates, buy supplies to start growing at
            home.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <p>
          We want to see interaction with the community go up, we would like to be seen as advisors/SMEs. We would
          like
          an increase in subscribers, larger event requests, and larger event attendance. The value to us is that we
          are
          able to have a process in place for urban gardening while Design.local is able to facilitate new challenge
          in
          agriculture, one of the fastest-growing tech sectors.
        </p>

        <h4>Success Measures</h4>
        <p>Outcomes could include a once a month workshop and a quarterly specialized news emailer.</p>

        <h4>Other Notes</h4>
        <p>
          There are agri-tech companies and people in the Waterloo Food Systems group interested in similar but not
          the
          exact same problem we are looking to tackle. We have partnered with groups and started building a network
          as
          we believe this is a pie that needs to be shared in order to see development/progress.
        </p>

        <h4>Deliverables</h4>
        <p>We would like to run this project agile scrum, right now we have a dream to see interaction and interest
          go
          up and would like to set metrics to measure those goals - having an agile approach to development will let
          us
          pivot and measure metrics reasonably as we progress over the next 4 weeks.
          We would like templates to run these workshops with an as little administrative burden as possible so we
          can
          focus on content. <br><br>Eg. a uniform template/marketing strategy for events & communications surrounding
          them
          (pre & post-event engagement)
          <ul>
            <li>Automated email marketing</li>
            <li>Vendor/Platform comparisons</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>

            Weâ€™ve set out to accomplish building a brand and marketing workshops templates that are tailored towards
            food system/food economic education, where the solution
            will require as little administrative burden as possible.
