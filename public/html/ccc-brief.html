        <h3>Creative Commons Canada</h3>
        <p><a href="https://ca.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Canada</a> is a global non-profit
          organization that works to build a globally-accessible public commons of knowledge and culture. Creative
          Commons Canada represents the global organization in Canada, engaging with Canadian members and the public.

        <h2>UX Research</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          Creative Commons Canada is looking to launch the next version of its website as part of engaging its existing
          audience and intention to grow its membership. They have a standard template (CC Globally shared, but locally
          modified WordPress), and content (a few posts ready to go, and a visioning document). Creative Commons Canada
          doesn’t have a good plan, or people who have the skill to put it together properly, with care. The
          organization would like to welcome new members, and develop some 'flow' to its membership and contributions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The existing Canadian community is not well-connected</li>
          <li>Membership growth is dependent on reaching new members - but the value proposition for new members isn’t
            well understood</li>
          <li>Ongoing operating of the organization would ideally be self-directed and managed by members, but the path
            to this state is unclear</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          This project should provide Creative Commons a clear understanding of its current membership and potential
          members to inform future outreach projects, including the launch of a new web site.</p>

        <p>Creative Commons serves an important role nationally and internationally, providing a means of connecting
          creators - which is relevant to Design.local’s membership.</p>

        <p>With the background research complete in this project, Creative Commons will be prepared to engage its new
          and existing audience in its growth.
        </p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>The primary users are the existing members, potential new users, and the current national administrative
          team.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Existing members are not well connected to one another;</li>
          <li>Potential new members are not well understood - what may motivate their involvement in the organization
            needs to be discovered</li>
          <li>The administrative team are few and volunteers - while they are enthusiastic, their time and resources are
            limited</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>Research to understand the primary users will be necessary to address the needs of each group.</p>

        <p>The output of this project will help to guide the organization’s next steps in growing the membership, reach,
          and activities of Creative Commons in Canada.</p>

        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <p>
          As an international organization held in high regard, this project should demonstrate Creative Commons
          commitment to inclusion and access to information.
        </p>

        <h4>Deliverables</h4>
        <p>A report that provides key insights on the users relevant to Creative Commons in Canada - members, potential
          members, and the administrative team. These insights will clearly describe the user groups’ motivations,
          interests, and relevant channels for communication and engagement. The output will need to be licensed CC-BY
          4.0.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            We’ve set out to gain a greater understanding of the existing and future audience for Creative Commons in
            Canada to provide guidance to the organization in its mission to grow its membership and impact nationally
            and in contributing to the global presence of Creative Commons.
