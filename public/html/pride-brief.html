        <h3>Pride Certified</h3>
        <p><a href="https://pridecertifieddotorg.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Pride Certified</a> is a not-for-profit
          corporation that is
          certifying businesses who are doing their best to create a sense of inclusivity.

        <h2>Branding+Product Design</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          It is difficult to find out if
          businesses and organizations cater to LGBTQ+ communities directly or if they are LGBTQ+ friendly or it is not
          within their missions and Values. Therefore, Pride Certified wants to create a larger sense of inclusivity
          within the Waterloo Region and the community at large.
        </p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of the project is to create branding and seal stamp to distribute to establishes, businesses, and
          organizations. We want the logo to be very recognizable and to give people of the LGBTQ+ community a sense of
          comfort.<br><br>
          This will help the local community, specifically, the LGBTQ+ community, identify safe spaces as well as assist
          other community members to help advocate and encourage safe spaces for everyone. By having Pride Certified on,
          we believe we can create a safe, inclusive, and nurturing community.
        </p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>The primary users we identified, are the business employers, who are looking to create a more inclusive work
          environment in the service industry (restaurants, hospitality, travel agents, transportation, healthcare,
          finances, insurance, real estate, etc). <br><br>
          The secondary users are the LGBTQ+ Community and a larger Local Community and hopefully National as well.</p>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>Businesses can apply and/or be sourced to be Prided Certified. This will hopefully have longevity within
          Waterloo Region and beyond.</p>

        <h4>Other Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a new project and endeavor. Pride Certified recently, in April, received non-profit status. This
            is the first of its kind in the Waterloo Region.</li>
          <li>Requirements include inclusion and sensitivity to LGBTQ+ communities.</li>
          <li>The logo, in particular, is important and the goal of the project as it will also be or closely related to
            the certification of Pride Certified. This logo will be featured in our “members” establishments. The hope
            is to use the branding created by Design.local Problem Solvers as the core outward facing voice of Pride
            Certified.</li>
          <li>Pride Certified's mission: To lead, develop, and maintain a standard of inclusivity, diversity, and
            equality that businesses need to maintain to be a Pride Certified business. To educate businesses and
            services on how to have diverse and inclusive business practices and foster a culture centered around sexual
            orientation equality and gender equality for their employees and their customers. To create an identifiable
            way to locate businesses that are committed to providing inclusive LGTBQ+ services for the community. </li>
          <li>Pride Certified's vision: To identify businesses that are committed to educating themselves on creating
            inclusive and diverse spaces for the LGTBQ+ community. </li>
        </ul>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            We’ve set out to accomplish the goal of creating Pride Certified branding and seal of approval stamps.
            People of the LGBTQ+ community will be able to identify establishments that are LGBTQ+ friendly. By
            providing branding for Pride Certified, we will be helping an often underserved demographic.
