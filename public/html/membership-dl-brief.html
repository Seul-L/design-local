        <h3>Design.local</h3>
        <p><a href="https://designdotlocal.ca" target="_blank">Design.local</a> is a multidisciplinary group of
          creators, designers, strategists, and developers that use their skills to solve design challenges with
          not-for-profit organizations around the world.

        <h2>System Design</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          Thanks to its greater than anticipated success, the organization have attracted many participants. This has
          introduced a level of administrative overhead that is untenable by the existing admin team, particularly with
          competing priorities due to COVID-19. The team needs help to continue supporting the growth of the
          organization. Of the more than 150 members who have joined design.local in the past 5 months, only a third
          have contributed to design challenges.
        </p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          This project seeks to create a structure that will allow design.local to continue to scale without placing
          undue demand on a small admin team; it should leverage the principles of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation" target="_blank">Teal organizations</a>
          (self-managing).
          Design.local’s future depends on sustaining the organization - this is at risk with overworked team members,
          and the potential for the current members losing interest in the organization.</p>

        <p>Once the project is finished, the organization will continue to grow sustainably, with more reason for others
          to join; the current admin team will not be overwhelmed by the work, and will have support from other members
          in the organization.</p>

        <p>Motivation as an admin member is that I want to see Design.local engage problem-solvers around the world, and
          I’d like to have the opportunity to help shape its positive and sustainable future.
        </p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>The followings are the users that we identified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design.local admin</li>
          <li>“New” members</li>
          <li>“Experienced” members</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>The followings are some of the pain points we identified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the Admin team, this project solves the problem of handling the growth of the organization, and the
            management of creating new teams and overseeing design challenges</li>
          <li>For the members, this project provides them with a progression path within the organization and a means
            for personal development and career growth</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>We would like to tackle the following flows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How do members join, get interested and participate in the organization</li>
          <li>How do members “level up” through their involvement in Design.local</li>
          <li>How does the admin team handle intake of projects</li>
          <li>How does the admin team create and brief new teams</li>
          <li>How does the admin team oversee the completion of challenges</li>
          <li>What is the succession for a member of the organization</li>
          <li>How does the admin team replace members over time</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <p>
          Design.local’s fundamental values must be represented in the solution - creating useful solutions that provide
          opportunities to problem solvers of all kinds.
        </p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The solution must be sustainable and allow for evolution</li>
          <li>Design.local’s brand must continue to be highly regarded</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>The solution will resonate with the membership and admin team; it must align with the organization’s
          objectives of solving problems with a primary objective of altruism.</p>

        <h4>Measuring Success</h4>
        <p>By the result of this challenge, we expect our members to start a path of personal development in the
          organization; they would have direction and an opportunity to gain more experience, skills, connections, and
          contribute to meaningful work. Furthermore, the admin team would continue to grow the scale of Design.local,
          take on more projects, and get more sleep.</p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we would know the solution is the best possible when the Design.local community embraces the
          solution, which will be reflected in an increase in membership involvement, and a reduction of demand on the
          admin team.</p>

        <h4>Other Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A proposed solution has been created, but it has not been tested</li>
          <li>Design.local has a limited budget</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Deliverables</h4>
        <p>A plan to help Design.local’s sustainable growth.</p>

        <div class="summary">
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            We’ve set out to create a sustainable membership model for Design.local that will leverage the community’s
            ability to self-organize and self-manage, support the management and execution of design challenges, and to
            grow Design.local’s impact globally.
