        <h2>Hydroponic System Design</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          We are urban farmers who are concerned about food system transparency and food security. We are looking to
          understand where we can bring value in the supply chain and would like to build a prototype to test vertical
          farming/hydroponic systems.
        </p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to design a hydroponic system for home use, that is aesthetically pleasing but
          also utilitarian in its ability to grow produce & collect data. We are aiming to create awareness around the
          nutrition food has today, elevate members of the community who are working to build and educate people around
          sustainable food systems, create educational workshops and test tools that can promote sustainable and
          affordable growth. We want to empower people to grow their own vegetables.<br><br>
          This specific project is trying to address an issue that will only get more attention, especially with the
          recent turn of events regarding COVID - people are concerned about who has handled their food and if it is
          safe to eat. In Canada, there has been a decline of skilled labour in Agriculture and we depend heavily on
          migrant workers to harvest crops -- these are early indicators farmers needing to understand how to develop
          crops strategically (ex. What we see in the green revolution) or signs of crop shortages and food price
          increasing.<br><br>The prototype will be a tool to conduct further research on how to move towards a circular
          economy and to provide local access to sustainable affordable agriculture. Food is an issue that impacts all
          animals, if we continue to live unsustainably it can cause harm to our bodies, animals around us and as well
          our natural resources.
          <br><br>Through sharing a design for an easy to build hydroponic system, we want people to be able to begin
          growing their own food. We would like for them to share their learnings to benefit the community at large
          (similar to citizen scientists). Through this we want to gradually build knowledge and expertise that can be
          shared to uplift each other’s ability to become self sufficient. Eg what lighting conditions worked for which
          veggies, what nutrients were used and how much, what were yields amounts & quality/taste of the produce grown
          at home.</p>

        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p><b>Users who we identified are:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Urban dwellers with limited outdoor growing space</li>
          <li>Community Gardens</li>
          <li>Schools (elementary, secondary, post-secondary)</li>
          <li>Citizen Scientists</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p><b>The pain points:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access to know-how on hydroponic best practices.</li>
          <li>Ease of use of equipment</li>
          <li>Ability to track and monitor growing conditions</li>
          <li>Aesthetically pleasing so that people are drawn to have fixtures at home. Typical hydroponic systems are
            unattractive, and lack appeal as a permanent fixture for peoples homes.</li>
          <li>Space & cost</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>There are two flows we’re looking at right now at a very high level.
        <ul>
          <li>The user interacts directly with the tool either at home, at work, at school or in a community garden.
          </li>
          <li>The user purchases produce that is harvested through the tool.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Users will get access to taste profile cards which will indicate how far the food has travelled or how to use
          the produce and educational information on how the taste is changing, how does the tool contributes to
          sustainability.</p>

        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <p>
          We want to understand which features matter most to consumers and the ability to experiment growing produce
          outside of leafy greens.
        </p>

        <h4>Other Notes</h4>
        <p>
          There are agri-tech companies and people in the Waterloo Food Systems group interested in similar but not the
          exact same problem we are looking to tackle. We have partnered with groups and started building a network as
          we believe this is a pie that needs to be shared in order to see development/progress.
        </p>

        <h4>Deliverables</h4>
        <p> A prototype of a hydroponics structure where we can run experiments.
        <ul>
          <li>Pricing Plan</li>
          <li>Design Plan</li>
          <li>Which metrics to collect & how to share them</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
