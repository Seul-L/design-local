        <h3>Canadian Low Income Artist & Musician Fund</h3>
        <p><a href="http://gf.me/u/xqyshk" target="_blank">Canadian Low Income Artist &
            Musician Fund (CLIAMF)</a> is a campaign created and organized by 2 individuals who want to provide support
          for
          low-income
          artists and musicians whose livelihoods are being affected by this pandemic.
          <br>
          Whether it's from cancelled gigs, lost jobs, or a lack of business due to coronavirus scares, our intention
          for this fund is to collectively raise money in order to provide emergency and preventative resources to those
          at financial risk until our government puts a solid plan in action to help.

        <h2>Website strategy</h2>
        <h4>Current situation</h4>
        <p>
          In order to raise the targeted goal of $5000 CAD, CLIAMF (Canadian Low Income Artist & Musician Fund) needs to
          raise awareness and encourage action towards their cause.
          <br>
          Currently the organization is running off of a spreadsheet, and a go-fund-me page but needs help putting
          together a website landing page, a social media strategy, and a network of advocates who can help promote this
          great cause.
        </p>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          Increase donations engagement, build online brand presence, and reach the target goal of $5000 CAD in
          donations. Some actionable items include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a way for people to learn more about this organization and ultimately donate to the cause</li>
          <li>Create a social media/outreach strategy to help raise awareness for this cause</li>
          <li>Fail fast - we want to ideate, build, test, measure, and repeat as efficiently as possible in order to get
            to a working solution as quickly as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>
          The user is yet to be determined until the design challenge is underway and the results have been reviewed.
          The stakeholders involved with this project include:
          <ul>
            <li>Musicians, Artists, Performers</li>
            <li>Galleries, Theater, Venues (Restaurants) </li>
            <li>Administrative staff</li>
            <li>Service industry and gig work- (lowest income bracket)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>
          Currently, there is a gofundme page that users can visit to learn more about this initiative but they need
          support in terms of getting a digital strategy in place.
        </p>
        <h4>Principles</h4>
        <p>
          We need a low-cost solution that is simple and can be managed by the two people who are managing this
          initiative.
        </p>

        <div class="summary">
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Weâ€™ve set out to provide a low-cost and easily managed strategy and roadmap which will help guide the
            Canadian Low Income Artist & Musician Fund to success in raising money for at-risk artists, musicians, and
            gig workers.
